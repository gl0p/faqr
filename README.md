# FAQR
## Fully Autonomous Quadruped Robot 

Ask it to find something and it will walk right up to it. Ask it to follow you, and it will stalk you. Tell it to stop and it will wait right there. Just dont ask it for cake.

Uses automated responces generated from https://glados.c-net.org/

Uses coco.names, a list of 91 objects you can ask it to find. 

Contact me if interested in building this. 

### Build Uses:

            UDOO Bolt V8
            Raspberry Pi 4B 2 gb (in serial mode)
            Webcam
            Sonar (HC-SR04) **Soon to be replaced with LIDAR
            13 servos (12 for movement, 1 for cam rotation)
            5.2 Ah 7.4 Volt lithium battery for servos
            PD Battery pack for remote operation
            1 or 2 speakers (amplifier optional)
           
            You might be able to get away with two Raspberry Pi's and an arduino.

## Soon to come: 

              Stair recognition and climbing
              LIDAR Support (replaces sonar)
              Room Mapping
              Last object location
              Waypoint GoTo from generated map
              Autonomous lingering (wanlking around when nothing to do, search the room to update map)
              Android app??? 
              Speech intention
              Lights or vocal display
              AI incorperation
